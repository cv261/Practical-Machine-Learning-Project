# Practical-Machine-Learning-Project


### Background :
Human Activity Recognition - HAR - has emerged as a key research area in the last years and is gaining increasing attention by the pervasive computing research community.

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

Subjects were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
1. Exactly according to the specification **(Class A)**
2. Throwing the elbows to the front **(Class B)** 
3. Lifting the dumbbell only halfway **(Class C)** 
4. Lowering the dumbbell only halfway **(Class D)**
5. Throwing the hips to the front **(Class E)** 

###Objective :

* In this project,the  goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
* Our training data consists of accelerometer data and a label identifying the quality of the activity the participant was doing. Our testing data consists of accelerometer data without the identifying label. Our goal is to predict the labels for the test set observations.
